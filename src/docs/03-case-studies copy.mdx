# Case studies

Welcome to our Case Studies section, where we explore the practical applications of DocsKit. Case studies offer in-depth insights into how DocsKit enhances the documentation process. We offer two types of case studies:

* **Feature case studies** demonstrate how specific DocsKit features address common challenges with practical examples and code snippets
* **Site case studies** showcase fully implemented DocsKit sites

These case studies provide a detailed look at the unique challenges, innovative solutions, and impressive outcomes achieved with DocsKit, serving as a comprehensive resource for your documentation needs.
