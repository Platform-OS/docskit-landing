# Sustainability

The digital world, including the internet, has a significant impact on our environment, an effect that's projected to increase with rising data traffic from mobile phones, broadband, and businesses.

A sustainable internet should embody the principles outlined in the [Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/), including:

* **Clean**: Services should be powered by renewable energy.
* **Efficient**: Products and services should use minimal energy and material resources.
* **Open**: Services should be accessible, support open information exchange, and give users control over their data.
* **Honest**: Services shouldn't mislead or exploit users in their design or content.
* **Regenerative**: Services should support an economy that benefits people and the planet.
* **Resilient**: Services should be functional when and where people need them most.

DocsKit equips you with the essential technical foundations for creating a sustainable documentation site, and we provide guidance on building your documentation in a way that minimizes its carbon footprint.

* **Hosting**: Opt for green hosting providers that run on renewable energy and follow eco-friendly practices. Tools like the Green Web Foundation's [Green Web Checker](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check) can help verify your website's energy source. DocsKit supports hosting on cloud infrastructure providers committed to renewable energy and sustainable practices such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. 
* **Performance**: Optimize your site's performance for energy efficiency. This includes strategic planning and ongoing tweaks and adjustments. Learn more about why [performance](/docskit/performance) matters and how efficient DocsKit sites are. 
* **Image Management**: Efficient management and optimization of images can significantly reduce energy consumption.
* **Video Management**: Similar to image management, handling videos efficiently can also aid in sustainability.
* **Fonts**: Choose and use fonts in a way that minimizes energy usage.
* **Web Caching**: Effective use of web caching can reduce server load and hence energy consumption.
* **User Experience**: Navigation and search functionalities should be designed for efficiency to minimize energy usage.
* **Content Management**: Effectively managing content can also contribute to a more sustainable website.
* **Search Engine Optimization**: An SEO-optimized website draws more targeted traffic, reducing unnecessary energy use.
* **Third-party Tools**: Be mindful of the energy footprint of third-party tools you incorporate into your site.
* **Maintenance**: Regular website maintenance can help ensure continued energy efficiency.

By considering these factors and adopting sustainable practices in web development, you can contribute to a greener and more sustainable internet.
