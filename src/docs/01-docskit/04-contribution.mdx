# Contribution

Contributions from various users significantly enhance your documentation. Diverse contributors bring different perspectives, insights, and knowledge to the project, helping to fill knowledge gaps, clarify complex areas, and add new information. This collective wisdom makes the documentation more comprehensive, accurate, and useful. The version control system of GitHub keeps track of these contributions, ensuring all changes are recorded and nothing is lost.

DocsKit enables all segments of your target audience to get involved, as it allows you to offer various methods of contribution, tailored to both the available time and skill level of the contributors. For some quick editing, like fixing typos or adding links, contributors can edit the content in the GitHub file editor. For heavy editing, adding new content, or developers who prefer to use git, we provide a complete Docs as Code workflow. 

_**Tip**: Make sure to thank all of your contributors, and display them on your documentation site or on your GitHub repositoryâ€™s README page._

## How DocsKit empowers contributors 

* **Code and content contributions**: GitHub enables easy contribution through its Fork and Pull model. A user can "fork" a project, creating their own copy of the repository where they can make changes. After making changes, users can propose these modifications to the original project through a "pull request". Members added to your GitHub repository can edit the content on the GiHub UI or use the Git tool of their choice. 
* **Issues**: By using GitHub Issues, your community members can open and discuss issues, and gain insight into your plans and ongoing work, including pull requests under review. With DocsKit the entire lifecycle of any task can be made fully transparent, allowing your users to track the complete process.
* **Style Guide**: The DocsKit package includes a style guide template that enables you to write a documentation style guide quickly. It contains guidelines for writing technical content (e.g. language, tone, etc.) and each basic content type in your documentation (e.g. tutorials, concept topics, etc.).
* **Templates**: DocsKit provides templates for the content types most used in documentation projects. Templates include all non-changeable content and placeholders with explanations for the parts to add. Placeholders provide information on the recommended format (e.g. title), and any requirements or limitations (e.g. maximum number of characters).
* **Contributor Guide**: The DocsKit template for your Contributor Guide describes ways for your community members to get involved. Make this guide as short as possible (ideally, less than a page) with links to relevant content (e.g. style guide, templates).
