# Documentation

Welcome to the DocsKit Documentation!

Here, you will find guides and resources to use DocsKit effectively:

* Step-by-step instructions in the [editorial workflow](/documentation/writing-editing-reviewing/) for writing, editing, and reviewing your documentation topics.
* The [Markdown markup language](/documentation/markdown/) guide to add formatting elements to your documentation pages.
* [Custom components](/documentation/components/) for use in your MDX documents, allowing additional styling and functionality.
* The [navigation system](/documentation/navigation) DocsKit employs to create website structure, main menu, and sidebar navigation.
* DocsKit's [theming layer](/documentation/theming) instructions for utilizing our customizable, accessible, and responsive theme.
* [Templates](/documentation/templates/) with standard content, placeholders, and instructions to assist in structuring your documentation. Written in the MDX format used by DocsKit, they also serve as a learning aid for those new to MDX.
